Author Comments: “Miles The Concierge“ Objective-C Example/Demonstration Application

Pre-Requisites: The Jabber Guest SDK for iOS must be integrated into this project before it will correctly function. This is a simple process. You can download the SDK and integration instructions from the URL in credits. Please note SDK version 10.6.8.863 has been tested only. Other SDK versions may be met with mixed results.

Synopsis: Miles The Concierge is a simple iOS application that uses the Core Location and Jabber Guest frameworks to demonstrate the concepts of Ranging and Region Monitoring with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons alongside broader platfrom integration possibilities. 

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate one of the many use cases BLE Beacons can provide i.e. user engagement and notification escalated to application handoff via Cisco collaboration (Jabber Guest video). This detection capability can provide the basis for user engagement based on location.

This application relies on the following UUID being configured for operation:

E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-0003-D0F5A71096E0

Motivation: The application was written to help educate interested people about the power of location based engagement using BLE beacons.
